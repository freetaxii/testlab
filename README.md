testlab contains a series of testing tools to automatically test a TAXII 2.1+ 
implementation with STIX 2.1+ content. It was written in the Go (Golang) 
programming language and as such each tool can be compiled into a standalone 
statically compiled native executable. 

## Version ##
0.3.1

## Test Setup ##
The three test tools listed below all require that an existing Discovery and 
API Root be pre-configured on the TAXII Server. This API root will be used for 
all tests in this suite. The name and path of this API root will need to be fed 
in to the test tools via a command line parameter. For example:

```
https://somesite.com/api1/
./basicTests -a api1

https://somesite.com/taxii/api1/
./basicTests -a taxii/api1
```

This API Root should be configured in one of two ways with the collections 
listed below. Configuration 2 the Read-Write Implementation is the most common 
and should be done by the majority of implementations.


### Configuration 1: Read Only Implementation ###
```
Read-only  Test Collection ID 22f763c1-e478-4765-8635-e4c32db665ea

{
    "collections": [
        {
            "id": "22f763c1-e478-4765-8635-e4c32db665ea",
            "title": "Read-Only TestLab Collection",
            "description": "This is a Read-Only collection for use with the FreeTAXII TestLab tool",
            "can_read": true,
            "can_write": false,
            "media_types": [
                "application/stix+json;version=2.1"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
This read-only collection MUST be empty before the data/indicators.json data
is loaded into it and MUST NOT contain any other data.


### Configuration 2: Read and Write Implementation ###
```
Read-only  Test Collection ID 22f763c1-e478-4765-8635-e4c32db665ea
Write-only Test Collection ID 4f7327e2-f5b4-4269-b6e0-3564d174ce69
Read-Write Test Collection ID 8c49f14d-8ea3-4f03-ab28-19dbca973dde

{
    "collections": [
        {
            "id": "22f763c1-e478-4765-8635-e4c32db665ea",
            "title": "Read-Only TestLab Collection",
            "description": "This is a Read-Only collection for use with the FreeTAXII TestLab tool",
            "can_read": true,
            "can_write": false,
            "media_types": [
                "application/stix+json;version=2.1"
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": "4f7327e2-f5b4-4269-b6e0-3564d174ce69",
            "title": "Write-Only TestLab Collection",
            "description": "This is a Write-Only collection for use with the FreeTAXII TestLab tool",
            "can_read": false,
            "can_write": true,
            "media_types": [
                "application/stix+json;version=2.1"
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": "8c49f14d-8ea3-4f03-ab28-19dbca973dde",
            "title": "Read-Write TestLab Collection",
            "description": "This is a Read-Write collection for use with the FreeTAXII TestLab tool",
            "can_read": true,
            "can_write": true,
            "media_types": [
                "application/stix+json;version=2.1"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```


## Test Tools ##

### basicTests.go ###
This tool will perform basic connectivity tests against every
endpoint. It will check media types for both the Accept and Content-Type headers
and will verify that the endpoint returns the right resource.

This test tool requires the following:
1) A working Discovery Endpoint
2) A working API Root Endpoint
3) A working Collections Endpoint

### getContentTests.go ###
This tool will perform various GET requests against the object endpoints for the 
read-only collection. It will test sorting and filtering of the data and ensure 
all of the object level endpoints return the right results. This tool will only
test with STIX Indicators.

This test tool requires the following:
1) All requirements of the basicTests.go
2) A read-only collection (22f763c1-e478-4765-8635-e4c32db665ea)
3) The provided STIX data (data/indicators.json) will need to be loaded into 
this read-only collection.
4) It is important to note that the read-only collection MUST be empty before the
indicators.json file is imported and MUST not contain any other data.

### addContentTests.go ###
This tool will perform various POST requests to the object
endpoints for write-only and read-write collections. It will then perform 
various GET requests for the data on the read-write collection to ensure the 
added data is correctly preserved. 

This test tool requires the following to be setup in advance:
1) All requirements of the basicTests.go
2) A write-only collection (4f7327e2-f5b4-4269-b6e0-3564d174ce69)
3) A read-write collection (8c49f14d-8ea3-4f03-ab28-19dbca973dde)
